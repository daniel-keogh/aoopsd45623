/*
 * SmithWaterman plays the role of a concrete state object in this lab. When the context
 * (StoredSequenceContext) changes state, it will switch the instance of the state 
 * interface (SequenceComparator) that it composed with.

 * A permitted subtype must declare how it continues the sealing initiated by its 
 * super-type. The class SmithWaterman declares that it is non-sealed, allowing its 
 * part of the inheritance hierarchy reverts to be re-opened for extension.
 *
 * The SmithWaterman distance algorithm computes the edit distance between two strings 
 * and accounts for substitutions, insertions and deletions and is able (using a trace-back
 * step that is not implemented here) to return the optimal matching subsequence. The algorithm 
 * has a space and time complexity of O(n^2).
