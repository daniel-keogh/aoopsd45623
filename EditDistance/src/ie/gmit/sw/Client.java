/* 
 * The Client class has dependencies on the target interface SequenceListStore and
 * on the Adapters InhStoredSequenceListAdapter and ComStoredSequenceListAdapter. 
 * However, the "Class Adapter" InhStoredSequenceListAdapter also places a transitive
 * dependency on the class StoredSequenceContext. 
 * 
 * The client knows nothing about the state abstraction (SequenceComparator) or any 
 * of the different concrete state objects (subtypes of SequenceComparator). If a 
 * Strategy Pattern had been used, the client would have been responsible for configuring
 * the context (StoredSequenceContext) with a concrete strategy and would therefore have
 * to know about, and have possible dependencies on, the classes Hamming, SmithWaterman,
 * Levenshtein and DamerauLevenshtein.
